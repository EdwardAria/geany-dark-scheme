# Contributions to the geany-dark scheme are very welcome!

Here's how to contribute.

## Creating and Installing Geany themes

### Short version

Extract and copy files to your ~/.config/geany/filedefs directory. Versions of geany older than 0.16 use the ~/.geany/filedefs folder instead.

### Long version

Instructions for creating and installing Geany schemes can be found here:
[http://www.geany.org/manual/current/index.html#filetype-definition-files]

The simplest way to create a filedef for a new language is to copy an existing one from the default install and change the colours.
