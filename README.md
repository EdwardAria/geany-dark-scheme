This is a dark syntax colouring theme for the [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) text editor.

Please help us extend the geany-dark theme to support new languages! Please extend the current theme by using the colours from one of the existing syntax files - that way they all play nice together.

## How to Install the Theme

### Linux: (Ubuntu)

#### Local User (just for you):

The simplest way to do this is to copy the contents of the filedefs folder into the `~/.config/geany/filedefs/` folder. This means that you can only have one theme installed at a time, though.

A better way, is to copy the contents filedefs folder into a `~/.config/geany/geany_dark_filedefs/` folder, creating the folder if it doesn't already exist. Then create a symlink to that folder:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/geany/geany_dark_filedefs/ ~/.config/geany/filedefs
```

This allows you to have several themes stored in your `~/.config/geany/` folder, and to change which one you're using by changing where the `~/.config/geany/filedefs` symlink points.

#### System Wide:

**BE SURE TO BACK UP THE EXISTING FILEDEFS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM!**

Copy the filedefs folder into `/usr/share/geany/`

**NOTE**: Geany may be installed in `/usr/local/geany/` or `/opt/geany/` depending on your OS or your installation method. Be sure to choose the correct directory. This method means that your filedef files will get overwritten when you upgrade Geany and also means that you can only have one theme installed at a time.

### Windows:
Copy the contents of the `filedefs` folder to...

**Current User only:**

`%APPDATA%\geany\filedefs`

**System Wide:**

**BE SURE TO BACK UP THE EXISTING FILEDEFS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM!**

`C:\Program Files\Geany\data`

NOTE: This method means that your filedef files will get overwritten when you upgrade Geany and also means that you can only have one theme installed at a time.
